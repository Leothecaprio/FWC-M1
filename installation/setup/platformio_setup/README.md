# 📱 Android: PlatformIO Installation Script

This guide explains how to create and run a shell script to install PlatformIO on Android (via Termux), ensuring you work **inside accessible storage (e.g., `/sdcard`)**, not the root directory.

---

## ⚠️ Important

📁 **Do not create the script in the root directory.**  
Always work inside accessible storage like `/sdcard` or `/storage`:

```bash
cd /sdcard
````

---

## 🛠️ Create the Installation Script

Use `nano` to create a new file:

```bash
nano platformio_installation.sh
```

Paste your PlatformIO installation commands inside, then save and exit (`CTRL + O`, `Enter`, `CTRL + X`).

---

## ✅ Make the Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x platformio_installation.sh
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Script

```bash
bash platformio_installation.sh
```

---

## 📌 Notes

* Make sure you have installed `termux` and run:

  ```bash
  pkg update
  pkg install git python
  ```

* You can install PlatformIO with:

  ```bash
  pip install platformio
  ```

---

## ✅ You're Done!

You now have a portable PlatformIO setup script that can be run directly from Android storage.
